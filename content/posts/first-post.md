Welcome to the world of Next.js! This post will walk you through the essentials of creating a new Next.js 14 application. We'll cover:

- Initializing a new project
- Understanding the App Router
- Integrating Tailwind CSS for styling
- Basic component creation

## Project Initialization

To start, ensure you have Node.js (version 18.17 or later) installed. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

Follow the prompts, selecting options like TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.

## App Router Explained

The App Router, introduced in Next.js 13, offers a new paradigm for building applications with React Server Components and nested layouts. Key features include:

-   `app` directory for routing
-   `layout.tsx` for shared UI
-   `page.tsx` for unique UI per route
-   Server Components by default for better performance

## Tailwind CSS Integration

If you selected Tailwind CSS during setup, `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` will be pre-configured. You can start using Tailwind utility classes immediately.

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
  Hello world!
</h1>
```
