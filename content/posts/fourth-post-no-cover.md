Web accessibility (often abbreviated as a11y) means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web.

## Why is Accessibility Important?

1.  **Ethical Imperative:** It's the right thing to do, ensuring equal access for everyone.
2.  **Legal Requirements:** Many countries have laws mandating web accessibility.
3.  **Business Benefits:**
    *   Wider audience reach.
    *   Improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
    *   Enhanced brand reputation.
    *   Better overall user experience for all users.

## Key Areas of Accessibility

-   **Perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive (e.g., alt text for images).
-   **Operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable (e.g., keyboard navigation).
-   **Understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable (e.g., clear and consistent navigation).
-   **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Simple Steps to Improve Accessibility

-   Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`).
-   Provide alternative text for images.
-   Ensure sufficient color contrast.
-   Design for keyboard-only navigation.
-   Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary.

Making the web accessible benefits everyone. By incorporating accessibility best practices into your development process, you create more inclusive and user-friendly digital products.
