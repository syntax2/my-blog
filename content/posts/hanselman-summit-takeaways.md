Scott Hanselman delivered an insightful talk at the Microsoft Student Ambassador Summit '21, packed with wisdom on navigating the tech world, fostering inclusion, and continuous learning. Here are some key takeaways:

## Attitude & Inclusion: Beyond the Invitation

*   **Diversity vs. Inclusion:** Hanselman draws a clear distinction. Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being on the party-planning committee. It's about actively involving people and consciously dismantling barriers, not just having different faces present.
*   **Rejecting the "Technology Priesthood":** Knowledge is power, often hoarded by experts. Avoid the "expert" trap of putting others down. Instead, share knowledge generously. Your goal should be to empower others ("Hey, I know this, and you can too!") rather than gatekeeping ("Leave it to the experts.").
*   **Don't Be a Gatekeeper:** Gatekeepers control information flow, often based on bias. They tell you *how* to learn (e.g., "learn C++ before Python"). Actively resist this. Encourage exploration and different paths.

## Share Your Energy & Build Your Presence

*   **Put Out Good Work:** Focus on quality and contribution.
*   **Finite Keystrokes:** Value your effort. Don't waste time on negativity or trivialities. Use your "keystrokes" wisely (check out [keysleft.com](https://keysleft.com) for a fun perspective).
*   **Share Experiences Liberally:** Your blog, your talks, your code – these are your experiences documented. Sharing them helps others and solidifies your own learning. Even sharing small insights twice a week adds up significantly over time.
*   **Kindness Matters:** The energy you put out often returns. Be supportive and kind within the community.

## Professionalism: Embracing the Amateur Mindset

*   **No "True" Professionals:** We are all learning. "20 years of experience" can mean learning and growing each year, or simply repeating the first year 20 times. Acknowledge your journey, including the times you "slept through" certain phases. Self-awareness is key.
*   **The Power of Failure:** Experience often translates to having failed safely over time. Embrace failures as learning opportunities.
*   **Be a Good Swiss Army Knife:** You don't need to be a master of *everything*. Aim to be competent and reliable in your core areas (a "good knife"), while having familiarity with others. You can't be the entire toolbox.
*   **Master the Fundamentals:** Don't skimp on the basics. Computer architecture, data structures, algorithms – these form the foundation upon which everything else is built. Visit [computerstufftheydontteachyou.com](http://computerstufftheydontteachyou.com) for inspiration.

## Mentorship vs. Sponsorship

*   **Seek Mentors:** You're never too old for good advice. A mentor guides and advises.
*   **Understand Sponsors:** A sponsor actively advocates for you. They can be strategizers, connectors, opportunity givers.
*   **Mentorship is Phased & Two-Way:** You might have different mentors for education, job searching, career growth, etc. It's a relationship, not a lecture series. Bring questions and engage actively. Ask mentors about the *fundamentals* they relied on.

Hanselman's talk was a powerful reminder to be inclusive, share generously, stay humble, focus on fundamentals, and actively seek guidance. These principles are timeless for anyone navigating their tech journey.
