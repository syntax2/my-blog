TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, adds static types to the language. This can significantly enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.

## Why TypeScript?

-   **Early Error Detection:** Catch type errors during development, not in production.
-   **Improved Readability:** Types make code easier to understand and reason about.
-   **Better Tooling:** Enhanced autocompletion, refactoring, and navigation in code editors.
-   **Scalability:** Manages complexity in large codebases more effectively.

## Basic Types

TypeScript provides several basic types:

-   `boolean`: `true` or `false`
-   `number`: All numeric values
-   `string`: Textual data
-   `array`: `number[]` or `Array<number>`
-   `object`: Any non-primitive type
-   `any`: Opt-out of type checking (use sparingly)

```typescript
let isDone: boolean = false;
let decimal: number = 6;
let color: string = "blue";

function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Interfaces and Classes

Interfaces define contracts for object shapes, while classes provide a blueprint for creating objects with methods and properties.

```typescript
interface Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

class Student implements Person {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  constructor(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}
```

Adopting TypeScript can be a game-changer for your web development workflow. Start small, integrate gradually, and enjoy the benefits of a more robust codebase.
